# GoCart Java Client Library

## Requirements

- Java 11 or later
- Merchant Id and Merchant Api Key. These should have been provided to you in onboarding.

### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.gocartpay</groupId>
    <artifactId>gocart-java-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Versions v1.0.2 and earlier should be **NOT** used. Versions prior to v2.0.0 did not have the ability to specify a base url and 
did not perform the correct authentication for GET methods that included a query string.

### Gradle Dependency
```
implementation 'com.gocartpay:gocart-java-sdk:2.0.1'
```

### If you would rather manually install the JAR
You can find the jar [here](https://github.com/GoCartPay/gocart-java-sdk/releases/tag/2.0.1)

## Documentation

Refer to [GoCart Documentation](https://docs.gocartpay.com/docs) for additional information that is not included in this readme.

### Configuration Required To Use The SDK
**You will need to create the following environment variables:**
- GOCART_API_BASE_URL = {your_gocart_api_base_url} <br>
  **Note:** If this environment variable is not set it will default to the GoCart staging environment URL
  - Staging: `https://api-staging.gocartpay.com`
  - Production: `https://api.gocartpay.com`
- GOCART_MERCHANT_ID = {your_merchant_id}
- GOCART_API_KEY = {your_api_key}
- REFERER_DOMAIN = {your_domain_url}

### Authentication
The GoCart APi uses MAC with SHA-256 to authenticate most requests. The gocart-java-sdk will do MAC with SHA-256 authorization for you.
You just need to have your properties set like the example below.
```java
import com.gocartpay.GoCart;

public class Example {
    
    public void setPropertiesWithEnvVars() {
        
        GoCart.goCartProperties = new GoCartProperties.Builder()
            .merchantId(System.getenv("GOCART_MERCHANT_ID"))
            .apiKey(System.getenv("GOCART_API_KEY"))
            .referer(System.getenv("REFERER_DOMAIN"))
            .build();
  }
  
}
```
